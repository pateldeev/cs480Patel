# Projects

## PA0: Triangle
This is a simple colored triangle on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA0``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA1: Spinning Cube
This is a cube that rotates in place on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA1``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA2: User Input
This builds on PA1 and adds user input to change the cube's movement. It also includes a simple menu system. To run this project ```cd PA2``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA3: Moon
This builds on PA2 and adds a "moon" cube to orbit and rotate around the already exisiting cube. To run this project ```cd PA3``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA4: Object Loader
This loads and renders an object exported from blendar as an .obj file. To run this project ```cd PA4``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA5: Assimp Object Loader
This uses the assimp library to load and render an object exported from blendar as an .obj file. To run this project ```cd PA5``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA6: Object & Texture Loader
This uses the assimp library in conjunction with the magick++ image library to render an object exported from blendar. This program will only render objects with texture coordinates. To run this project ```cd PA6``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA7: Solar System
This renders a solar system simulation with all major planets and moons. To run this project ```cd PA7``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA8: Collisions with Bullet - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
This uses the Bullet physics engine to create dynamic object collisons on a board. To run this project ```cd PA8``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.
