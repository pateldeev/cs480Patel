# Projects

## PA00: Triangle
This is a simple colored triangle on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA00``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA01: Spinning Cube
This is a cube that rotates in place on the screen. To run this project ```cd PA01``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA02: User Input
This builds on PA1 and adds user input to change the cube's movement. It also includes a simple menu system. To run this project ```cd PA02``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA03: Moon
This builds on PA2 and adds a "moon" cube to orbit and rotate around the already exisiting cube. To run this project ```cd PA03``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA04: Object Loader
This loads and renders an object exported from blendar as an .obj file. To run this project ```cd PA04``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA05: Assimp Object Loader
This uses the assimp library to load and render an object exported from blendar as an .obj file. To run this project ```cd PA05``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA06: Object & Texture Loader
This uses the assimp library in conjunction with the magick++ image library to render an object exported from blendar. This program will only render objects with texture coordinates. To run this project ```cd PA06``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA07: Solar System
This renders a solar system simulation with all major planets and moons. To run this project ```cd PA07``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA08: Collisions with Bullet 
This uses the Bullet physics engine to create simple object collisons on a board. To run this project ```cd PA08``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA09: Lighting with Bullet
This uses the Bullet physics engine to create simple object collisons with lighting (per vertex and per fragment) on a board.To run this project ```cd PA09``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA10: Pinball
This project is a fully functional pinball game. To run this project ```cd PA10``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.

## PA11: Final Project
This project is a two player game based on Conway's Game of Life. It is played on a 3-D board. To run this project ```cd PA11``` then follow the instructions in the README.md.
